Paper cLUb leader raNDomizER

Tired of always being short of volunteers for paper club? Tired of always leading group discussion despite having class and teaching 
responsibilities? Look no further. PLUNDER is a simple randomizer that, given a list of people... randomly selects one! 
However, you can initialize the probability distribution as a "tiered" uniform distribution, allocating a higher 
likelihood of being slected to folks in a certain tier (such as those who aren't teaching, for example). No more excuses!
